## Local Stack

It is possible to start a local stack, in order to quickly try changes locally.

For this, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

Then, you will need to create a `.env` file, based on the `.env.example` file, and fill in the secrets.

Finally, you can start the stack with:

```sh
docker-compose up -d # You can ignore the `-d` to see the logs in real time
```

You can open the UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To create the catalogues, run:

```sh
./scripts/catalogues.sh
```

To remove them, run:

```sh
./scripts/catalogues_delete.sh
```

To stop the stack, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```
